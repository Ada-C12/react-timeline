Feature | Feedback
:------------- | :-------------
Git hygiene | Very good!
Comprehension Questions | Good job!
**React Components** |
TimelineEvent component is implemented| Yes!
Timeline component is implemented | Yes!
App component is implemented | Yes!
Data is passed through props to subcomponents overall | Yes!
**Overall**  | I really like how clean the App.js looks, easy to read since you put the json -> timelineEvent component into Timeline.js (I also think it makes more sense there) GJ!
